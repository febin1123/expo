    Input
        A headline and a body text - either from the same news article or from two different articles.
    Output
        Classify the stance of the body text relative to the claim made in the headline into one of four categories:
            Agrees: The body text agrees with the headline.
            Disagrees: The body text disagrees with the headline.
            Discusses: The body text discuss the same topic as the headline, but does not take a position
            Unrelated: The body text discusses a different topic than the headline

evaluation:


    Teams will be evaluated based on a weighted, two-level scoring system:

        Level 1: Classify headline and body text as related or unrelated 25% score weighting

        Level 2: Classify related pairs as agrees, disagrees, or discusses 75% score weighting

    Rationale: The related/unrelated classification task is expected to be much easier and is less relevant for detecting fake news, so it is given less weight in the evaluation metric. The Stance Detection task (classify as agrees, disagrees or discuss) is both more difficult and more relevant to fake news detection, so is to be given much more weight in the evaluation metric
